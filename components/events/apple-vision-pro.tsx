	description: <>
		<p>Apple Vision Pro, launched in February 2024, represents Apple&apos;s entry into
			<strong>spatial computing</strong>, a new computing paradigm that blends digital content
			with the physical world. It introduces revolutionary interface concepts that could define
			the next era of human-computer interaction.</p>

		<h3>Your Eyes and Hands Are the Interface</h3>
		<p>Vision Pro pioneered revolutionary input methods. Eye tracking lets you look at interface
			elements to target them. Hand gestures (pinch to select) work without controllers. Voice
			commands enable natural language interaction. The Digital Crown controls immersion level.
			No physical controllers needed: your eyes and hands are the interface. It&apos;s the most
			natural computer interface ever created, or the most unnatural, depending on your
			perspective.</p>

		<h3>Computing in Three Dimensions</h3>
		<p>Vision Pro introduced new UI concepts for 3D space. Apps float as windows in your
			environment. You have an infinite canvas with unlimited screen space. Apps can be any
			size, anywhere, with depth and scale. Passthrough blends digital and physical seamlessly.
			The immersion dial controls how much you see of the real world. Computing is no longer
			bound to flat rectangles.</p>

		<p>Vision Pro&apos;s EyeSight feature addresses social isolation. An external display shows
			your eyes to others. A presence indicator shows when you&apos;re in an app versus fully
			immersed. It maintains social awareness and connection with physical space. It&apos;s
			Apple&apos;s attempt to make spatial computing less isolating, though whether it succeeds
			remains to be seen.</p>

		<h3>A New Design Language</h3>
		<p>visionOS established design patterns for spatial computing. Glass materials create
			translucent windows with depth. Spatial audio positions sound in 3D space. Virtual objects
			respond to real lighting. Shadows and reflections ground virtual objects in space. Hover
			effects provide subtle feedback when you look at elements. It&apos;s a complete design
			language for a new computing paradigm.</p>

		<p>Vision Pro made eye tracking the primary targeting mechanism. Look at what you want to
			interact with for instant targeting. Pinch to select with a hand gesture to confirm
			selection. It&apos;s natural and fast, faster than moving a cursor. The accessibility
			implications are profound: it enables interaction for users with limited mobility.</p>

		<h3>The Reality Check</h3>
		<p>Vision Pro faces significant challenges. The $3,499 price limits adoption to early
			adopters and professionals. Weight affects comfort for extended use. Social acceptance
			of wearing headsets in public remains questionable. The app ecosystem needs time to
			develop. Finding killer apps for spatial computing is an ongoing challenge. These
			aren&apos;t small problems.</p>

		<p>Vision Pro introduced new development paradigms. SwiftUI for spatial brings familiar tools
			to 3D interfaces. RealityKit handles 3D rendering and physics. ARKit provides spatial
			understanding. New spatial design patterns establish UI conventions. Developers have to
			learn an entirely new way of thinking about interfaces.</p>

		<h3>A Potential Platform Shift</h3>
		<p>Vision Pro represents a potential platform shift. Post-screen computing where interfaces
			aren&apos;t bound to rectangles. Natural interaction with eyes and hands as primary input.
			Spatial awareness where computing understands 3D space. Mixed reality seamlessly blending
			digital and physical. These concepts could define the next era of computing, or they
			could remain niche for decades.</p>

		<p>Vision Pro&apos;s launch accelerated spatial computing across the industry. Meta Quest
			continued investment in VR/MR. Google renewed interest in AR. Microsoft HoloLens pushed
			enterprise spatial computing. Industry alignment on spatial UI patterns began.
			Apple&apos;s entry legitimized the category, even if adoption remains limited.</p>

		<p>Vision Pro is Apple&apos;s bet on the future of computing. Spatial computing as the next
			major platform after mobile. Natural interfaces moving beyond keyboards and mice. Ambient
			computing where technology surrounds you. New interaction paradigms with eye tracking and
			spatial gestures. It&apos;s a bold vision that may take years or decades to realize.</p>

		<h3>Lasting Impact</h3>
		<p>Whether Vision Pro succeeds commercially or not, it established <strong>interaction
			patterns for spatial computing</strong>. Eye tracking as primary input, hand gestures for
			confirmation, and spatial window management could influence interfaces for decades. Vision
			Pro demonstrated that spatial computing could be elegant and intuitive, not just
			technically impressive.</p>

		<p>Like the <Link href="/event/iphone">iPhone</Link> redefined mobile interfaces, Vision Pro
			aims to define spatial computing interfaces. It&apos;s too early to know if it will
			succeed, but Vision Pro represents Apple&apos;s vision for how we&apos;ll interact with
			computers in the future: naturally, spatially, and without barriers between digital and
			physical worlds.</p>
