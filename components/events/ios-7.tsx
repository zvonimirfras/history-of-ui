	description: <>
		<p>iOS 7, led by <strong>Jony Ive</strong> after Scott Forstall&apos;s departure,
			represented the <strong>most dramatic visual redesign in iOS history</strong>. Apple
			abandoned the skeuomorphic design philosophy (realistic textures, shadows, and 3D
			effects) in favor of a flat, minimal aesthetic.</p>

		<h3>Visual Transformation</h3>
		<p>iOS 7 embraced flat design with minimal shadows and simplified shapes. Vibrant colors
			replaced muted tones with a bright, saturated palette. Translucency created frosted
			glass effects showing depth. Simplified icons became colorful glyphs without gradients.
			Typography-first design used thin Helvetica Neue throughout. The transformation was
			total: every pixel was redesigned.</p>

		<h3>New Interaction Paradigms</h3>
		<p>iOS 7 introduced new interaction patterns: edge-to-edge content maximized screen space,
			translucent layers revealed depth through transparency, physics-based animations made
			the interface feel responsive and alive, and Control Center provided quick settings from
			any screen. These changes weren&apos;t just visual: they changed how people interacted
			with their phones.</p>

		<h3>Industry Impact</h3>
		<p>The redesign polarized users initially (many found it too stark), but it established a
			new design language that influenced mobile and web design industry-wide. iOS 7&apos;s
			release marked the <strong>end of skeuomorphism&apos;s dominance</strong> and
			accelerated the flat design trend, making 2013 a watershed year for digital interface
			design.</p>
