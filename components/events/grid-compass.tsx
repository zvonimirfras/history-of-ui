	description: <>
		<p>The GRiD Compass 1100, designed by <strong>Bill Moggridge</strong>, was the first portable
			computer to be called a <strong>&quot;laptop.&quot;</strong> It featured a revolutionary
			clamshell design that folded flat for transport, establishing the form factor still used
			today.</p>

		<h3>Innovative Design Features</h3>
		<p>The Compass featured a clamshell folding design where the display folded down over the
			keyboard. An electroluminescent display showed sharp orange-on-black text. The die-cast
			magnesium alloy case was extremely durable yet light. Bubble memory provided 340KB of
			non-volatile storage without spinning disks. A built-in 1200 baud modem enabled remote
			communication. Each feature solved a specific problem of portable computing, and together
			they defined what a laptop should be.</p>

		<h3>Premium Product</h3>
		<p>Priced at <strong>$8,150-$10,000</strong>, the Compass was aimed at business executives
			and professionals who needed computing on the go. Its industrial design emphasized
			quality and portability, a sharp contrast to the beige plastic desktop PCs of the era.
			This wasn&apos;t a computer for everyone; it was a tool for professionals who could
			justify the cost.</p>

		<h3>NASA & Space Shuttle</h3>
		<p>NASA adopted the GRiD Compass for use on <strong>Space Shuttle missions starting in
			1983</strong>, where its ruggedness, reliability, and compact form factor proved
			invaluable in the constrained environment of orbit. This gave the Compass tremendous
			prestige and validated the laptop concept. If it could work in space, it could work
			anywhere.</p>

		<h3>Design Legacy</h3>
		<p>The design was so influential that it&apos;s now in the <strong>permanent collection of
			the Museum of Modern Art</strong>. Moggridge&apos;s work on the Compass contributed
			significantly to the field of <strong>interaction design</strong>. He later co-founded
			IDEO and wrote the seminal book &quot;Designing Interactions.&quot; The Compass proved
			that portable computing was possible and defined the form factor we still use today.</p>
