	description: <>
		<p>The Xerox Alto, developed at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), was the first
			computer to use a <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong> and the first to
			support the <strong>desktop metaphor</strong>. It featured a bitmapped display, a mouse
			for input, and was the first computer designed around a GUI.</p>

		<h3>Revolutionary Features</h3>
		<p>The Alto introduced many concepts that would become standard in personal computing.
			Overlapping windows let you view multiple documents simultaneously. Icons provided
			visual representations of files and programs. Menus organized commands in dropdown
			lists. A WYSIWYG editor showed exactly what would print. Ethernet networking connected
			multiple computers. Laser printing produced high-quality document output. These
			features seem obvious now, but in 1973, they were revolutionary. Most computers still
			used command-line interfaces and punch cards.</p>

		<h3>Impact & Legacy</h3>
		<p>Though never sold commercially and only about 2,000 units were built for Xerox and
			research institutions, the Alto&apos;s influence on the computing industry was
			immeasurable. It directly inspired both Apple&apos;s <strong>Lisa and Macintosh</strong>,
			and later <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong>. The Alto proved that GUIs were the future
			of computing, even if Xerox failed to capitalize on their own invention.</p>
