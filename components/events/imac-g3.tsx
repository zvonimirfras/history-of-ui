	description: <>
		<p>The iMac G3, designed by <strong>Jonathan Ive</strong> under Steve Jobs&apos;
			direction, was the computer that <strong>saved Apple from bankruptcy</strong> and
			redefined consumer electronics design.</p>

		<h3>Revolutionary Design</h3>
		<p>Its translucent <strong>Bondi Blue</strong> plastic enclosure was revolutionary. At a
			time when computers were beige boxes, the iMac looked like a piece of consumer
			electronics or even furniture. The &quot;i&quot; stood for <strong>Internet</strong>,
			emphasizing its focus on easy Internet connectivity.</p>

		<h3>Bold Design Decisions</h3>
		<p>The iMac made controversial but forward-thinking choices: all-in-one design integrated
			display and computer (eliminating cable clutter), no floppy drive (controversial at the
			time), USB only with no legacy ports (pushing industry USB adoption), and translucent
			colors (Lime, Strawberry, Blueberry, Grape, Tangerine). These decisions were radical.
			Critics said removing the floppy drive was suicide. Jobs was right; they were wrong.</p>

		<h3>Market Success</h3>
		<p>Jobs positioned it as the computer for people who wanted to get on the Internet easily.
			The iMac sold <strong>278,000 units in six weeks</strong> and <strong>800,000 in the
			first five months</strong>, establishing Apple&apos;s design-focused philosophy and
			beginning the company&apos;s remarkable turnaround.</p>
