		<p>Designed by <strong>Richard Sapper</strong>, the ThinkPad line revolutionized laptop design
			with its minimalist aesthetic and user-focused features. It became synonymous with
			serious business computing.</p>

		<h3>Iconic TrackPoint</h3>
		<p>The <strong>TrackPoint pointing device</strong>, a small red joystick embedded in the
			keyboard, allowed users to control the cursor without moving their hands from the typing
			position. This was a significant ergonomic innovation. Users could navigate precisely
			while keeping their fingers on the home row, dramatically improving typing efficiency.</p>

		<h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
		<p>The ThinkPad&apos;s design was inspired by the <strong>Japanese shokado bento box</strong>,
			emphasizing clean lines and functionality. The matte black fini
			sh conveyed professional,
			understated elegance. Red accents on the TrackPoint and ThinkPad logo provided the only
			color. Soft-touch paint gave a comfortable, premium feel. A seven-row keyboard offered
			optimal key spacing and travel. The ThinkLight (in later models) illuminated the keyboard.
			Every design choice served a purpose: this was a tool, not a fashion statement.</p>

		<h3>Technical Excellence</h3>
		<p>The ThinkPad 700C featured a <strong>10.4-inch color TFT display</strong>, Intel 486
			processor, and up to 16MB RAM. Later models introduced the innovative <strong>butterfly
				keyboard</strong> that expanded when opened, providing a full-size keyboard in a smaller
			chassis. It was engineering in service of usability.</p>

		<h3>Legendary Durability</h3>
		<p>ThinkPads quickly became the laptop of choice for <strong>business professionals</strong> and
			are still renowned for their military-grade durability (tested to MIL-SPEC standards),
			excellent keyboards (considered the best in the industry), reliability (built to last for
			years of heavy use), and serviceability (easy to repair and upgrade). These weren&apos;t
			consumer laptops; they were professional tools built to withstand years of abuse.</p>

		<h3>Cultural Impact & Legacy</h3>
		<p>The design was so influential that a ThinkPad is in the <strong>permanent collection of
			the Museum of Modern Art</strong>. ThinkPads were used by astronauts on the International
			Space Station and became the computer of choice for professionals who valued reliability
			over flashy design.</p>

		<p>IBM sold the ThinkPad line to <strong>Lenovo in 2005</strong>, but the brand continues
			today, maintaining its reputation for quality keyboards, the TrackPoint, and
			business-focused design. The ThinkPad proved that computers could be tools, not toys.</p>
