		<h3>The Deal</h3>
		<p>Xerox had developed groundbreaking GUI technology at their Palo Alto Research Center
		(PARC) but failed to commercialize it effectively. Apple, recognizing its value,
		negotiated access to these innovations in exchange for allowing Xerox to buy
		<strong>$1 million of Apple stock</strong> before its IPO.</p>

		<h3>The Demonstration</h3>
		<p>During three days of demonstrations in <strong>December 1979</strong>, Steve Jobs and
		his team witnessed the Alto computer with overlapping windows showing multiple
		documents visible at once, icons as graphical file representations, pop-up menus with
		context-sensitive commands, and a mouse-driven interface for point-and-click
		interaction. Jobs famously said he saw the future of computing in that moment. He was
		right, but it would be Apple, not Xerox, that brought that future to market.</p>

		<h3>Historical Significance</h3>
		<p>This exchange is often considered <strong>one of the most significant technology
			transfers in history</strong>, directly inspiring the development of Apple&apos;s Lisa
			and Macintosh computers. Xerox later felt they had given away too much for too little.
			They had shown Apple the future, and Apple ran with it while Xerox fumbled.
			It&apos;s one of the great &quot;what ifs&quot; of computing history: what if Xerox
			had commercialized their own inventions?</p>
