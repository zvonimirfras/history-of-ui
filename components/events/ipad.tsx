	description: <>
		<p>The iPad, introduced by Steve Jobs in <strong>2010</strong>, created the modern tablet
			computer category and demonstrated that touch interfaces could work at larger scales.</p>

		<h3>Why iPad Succeeded Where Others Failed</h3>
		<p>While tablets existed before (Microsoft spent a decade trying to make them work), the
			iPad succeeded because it wasn&apos;t just a bigger phone or a laptop without a
			keyboard. It was <strong>designed specifically for the tablet form factor</strong>.</p>

		<h3>Tablet-Optimized Interfaces</h3>
		<p>The <strong>9.7-inch multi-touch display</strong> provided enough space for reading,
			browsing, and content creation while remaining portable. iPad apps could reimagine
			interfaces with more screen real estate: split views (two apps side by side), popovers
			(contextual menus and options), master-detail layouts (efficient use of space), and
			creative tools like GarageBand and iMovie that showed touchscreen potential. The iPad
			proved that touch interfaces could be productive, not just consumptive.</p>

		<h3>Unexpected Markets</h3>
		<p>The iPad found unexpected markets in <strong>education, retail point-of-sale, medical
			facilities, and cockpits</strong>. While critics called it &quot;just a big iPhone,&quot;
			the iPad sold <strong>3 million units in 80 days</strong>.</p>

		<h3>Legacy</h3>
		<p>It proved that post-PC devices could be legitimate computers for many tasks, accelerated
			the shift away from keyboards, and established tablets as a distinct device category.</p>
