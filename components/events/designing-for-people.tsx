	description: <>
		<p>Henry Dreyfuss, one of America&apos;s most influential industrial designers, published
			&quot;Designing for People&quot; in 1955, establishing foundational principles for
			user-centered design. His philosophy emphasized that products should adapt to human needs
			rather than forcing humans to adapt to products.</p>

		<p>Dreyfuss introduced the concept of &quot;human factors&quot; in design and created the
			famous Joe and Josephine anthropometric models to represent average human measurements.
			His work influenced everything from telephone handsets to tractors, and his principles
			became cornerstones of modern UX design.</p>

		<p>He believed that when a product&apos;s design doesn&apos;t work for people, the fault
			lies with the designer, not the user.</p>
