	description: <>
		<p>Windows 95 was a revolutionary operating system that brought Microsoft into the modern
			GUI era and made Windows the dominant desktop OS.</p>

		<h3>Iconic Interface Elements</h3>
		<p>Windows 95 introduced the Start button, the now-iconic way to launch programs that
			remains in Windows today. The taskbar provided persistent program switching at the
			bottom of the screen. The desktop with icons created a visual workspace metaphor. Long
			file names (up to 255 characters, finally!) replaced the archaic 8.3 DOS naming.
			Plug-and-play enabled automatic hardware installation. 32-bit architecture improved
			performance and stability. These weren&apos;t just features; they defined how people
			expected computers to work.</p>

		<h3>Cultural Phenomenon</h3>
		<p>The launch was a <strong>massive cultural event</strong>. Microsoft spent over
			<strong>$300 million on marketing</strong>, including using the Rolling Stones&apos;
			&quot;Start Me Up&quot; in commercials. The midnight launch on August 24, 1995, saw
			people lining up at stores, unprecedented for software.</p>

		<h3>Market Domination</h3>
		<p>Windows 95 sold <strong>7 million copies in the first five weeks</strong>. Its success
			established design patterns still used in Windows today and helped Microsoft dominate
			the PC market through the late 1990s and 2000s.</p>
